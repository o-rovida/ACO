Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem

This Python script implements an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP involves finding the shortest possible route that visits a given set of cities and returns to the starting city. The ACO algorithm simulates the foraging behavior of ants to find an optimal or near-optimal solution.
